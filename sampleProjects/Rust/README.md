# Overview


This Rust program serves as a temperature converter between Fahrenheit and Celsius. It offers a menu-driven interface for users to choose conversion types, view conversion history, or quit the program. The program also provides contextual suggestions based on the converted temperature, such as "It's freezing!" or "It's hot!".
