# Overview

This Java program is a quiz application featuring a graphical user interface built with Swing. It loads multiple-choice questions from a QuestionBank class, shuffles them, and presents them to the user one by one. The quiz keeps track of the user's score and displays it upon completion. User responses are collected through radio buttons, and a timer is implemented to restart the quiz automatically.
