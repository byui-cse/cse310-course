        <h1>W03 Teach: Create Team Project Plan</h1>

        <p>You have been organized into teams. During the first Sprint, you should meet together in a video conference call to meet each other, read the <a href="../modules/team_project_description_campus.html" target="_blank">Team Project Description</a> together, establish your Jira board schedule, decide on a project, and submit the Team Project Plan.

        <p>The team needs to regularly communicate in Microsoft Teams (every 1-2 days during the week) and keep the Jira workspace constantly updated. If you are dilligent with your communication, then it will reduce your need to have video conference calls. You should organize a video call if you are having a difficult problem that you need to solve in person together. You should also organize a video call during the week if you are not getting consistent communication during the week.</p>
