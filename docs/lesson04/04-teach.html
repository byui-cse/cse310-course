        <h2>Team Meeting Agenda</h2>

        <p>You need to meet together as a team at least once this week. Your recommended agenda is as follows:</p>

            <li>
                <p>Opening prayer.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Review the class schedule to remind each other what is happening this week and what is due this week.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Select a member of the team to be the project team leader.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Agree on a proposed project and complete the Project Plan (see below) together.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Identify what needs to be researched and make assignments to team members. It is recommended that team members write code (proof of concept) to demonstrate the results of their research.</p>
            </li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Team Project Plan</h2>

        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>Make a copy of this <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1yg2hAPhjWy0aAm42zZAIyMSVYdGCf9WJdr4jN4H0vYM/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">cse310_team_project_plan document</a>.</p>

            <li>
                <p>Fill all parts of the project plan include proposal, schedule, and identification of the project team leader.
        </ol>
        <p>You may start work on your project after submitting your plan. However, you may be asked by your teacher to modify your proposed project. You should respond to feedback from your teacher quickly to get an approved project plan. </p>
